    A class to manage Vultr firewall groups and their rules via the Vultr API.
    Attributes:
        firewall_id (str): The ID of the selected firewall group.

        firewall_rules_header (list): Column headers for displaying firewall rules.
    Methods:
        __init__(api):
            Initializes the Firewall object with the provided API client.
        get_firewalls():
            Retrieves all firewall groups, prompts the user to select one, and loads its rules.
        get_firewall():
            Retrieves and updates the description of the currently selected firewall group.
        print_firewall():
            Prints details of the currently selected firewall group.
        create_firewall_prompt():
            Prompts the user for a new firewall group name and creates it.
        create_firewall(body):
            Creates a new firewall group with the provided body.
        delete_firewall():
            Deletes the currently selected firewall group.

            Retrieves and stores the rules for the currently selected firewall group.

            Adds rules for the current public IPv4 address to the selected firewall group.
        __firewall_selected():
            Checks if a firewall group is selected; prints a message if not.
    Note:
        This class depends on external utility functions such as valid_response_vultr, print_input_menu, utc_to_local, and tabulate, as well as an API client with api_get, api_post, and api_delete methods.
